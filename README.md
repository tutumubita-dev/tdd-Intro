# TDD Intro

This is the first of many TDD activities! This style of problem set will
help you prepare for technical interviews.

## Instructions

Complete each function in `index.js` according to the JSDoc.

Run `npm test` in your terminal to test your code. Try to pass all test cases!

> [!TIP]
>
> You can change `describe` to `describe.only` in `index.test.js` if you want
> to see _only_ that test suite in your terminal. This helps you avoid cluttering
> your terminal with tests that you are currently not working on.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Make sure you run `npm install` at least once to download the project
> dependencies before testing your code.
